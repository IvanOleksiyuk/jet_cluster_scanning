# jet_cluster_scanning

These are my experiments concerning the anomaly detection using k-means to separate space into bins for bump hunting.

I am a beginer programmer so any constructive criticism is very wellcome.

Short algorythm on how to use the prject:
0. 	extrat jet constituents (e.g. LHCO) (not realised in this project (DIY if needed I guess))
1.	Use ... to turn (e.g. LHCO) jet constituent data into images
2.	Use ... to sort images in the datasets with respect to the events invariant mass (e.g. jj_mass)
3.	Use cluster_scanning.py funcion with configs 
	... 
to bootstrap resample the background only sample and perform ananlysis on each resampling in order to get a background hypothesis distribution of the 
4.1	Use cluster_scanning.py funcion with configs 
		... 
to simmulare analysis in case of signal contamination
4.2	Use cs_prformance_evaluateon.py with plotting function to visualise the process of test statistic evaluation for a givec cluster_scanning run
5. 	Use t_statistic_distribution.py with configs
	... 
to generate the null-hypothesis distribution of the test statistic and show the test statistic and the significance for the case of different levels of signal contaminations
